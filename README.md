# Machine Learning Approaches for Bookstore Inventory Management: Book Rating Predictive System and Segmented Book Recommendation System #

## Project Description
--------

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques in revolutionizing bookstore management strategies and customer interactions. Leveraging data analysis and preprocessing, decision tree analysis, and K-Means clustering, the project aims to enhance decision-making processes and improve business management practices within the bookstore industry.

The project begins with a comprehensive data preprocessing phase, addressing missing values, anomalies, and standardizing textual data. This ensures the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis. Subsequently, a decision tree prediction system is implemented to predict book ratings, enabling informed inventory management decisions.

Additionally, K-Means clustering is employed for books segmentation, facilitating tailored book recommendations based on customer preferences. Through feature selection, model training, and evaluation, the project demonstrates the transformative potential of machine learning in optimizing bookstore operations and enriching customer experiences.

# CODE IMPLEMENTATION #

### Preprocess.py

The `preprocess.py` file is an essential component of the project, responsible for preprocessing the raw data before feeding it into the machine learning models. This script employs various preprocessing techniques to ensure the quality and integrity of the dataset, making it suitable for analysis and model training.

#### Functions:

1. **weighted_age_dect**
   - This function calculates the weights for different age groups based on the distribution of user ages in the raw data.
   - Returns a dictionary containing the weights for each age group.

2. **ages_imputation**
   - Utilizes the weights generated by the `weighted_age_dect` function to impute missing age data.
   - Ensures that the imputed age distribution closely matches that of the raw data.
   - Handles erroneous age data exceeding 100 in a consistent manner.

3. **country_imputation**
   - Imputes missing country data by randomly selecting countries from the known range of countries in the dataset.
   - Ensures that only valid country names are selected to maintain data integrity.

4. **city_imputation**
   - Imputes missing city data by randomly selecting cities from the known range of cities in the dataset.
   - Ensures that only valid city names are selected to maintain data integrity.

5. **state_imputation**
   - Imputes missing state data by randomly selecting states from the known range of states in the dataset.
   - Ensures that only valid state names are selected to maintain data integrity.

6. **author_imputation**
   - Fills missing author data for books with "NO AUTHOR" to maintain consistency in the dataset.

7. **discretising**
   - Discretizes user ages into 10-year bins, ranging from 0 to 100.
   - Discretizes ratings into three categories: "low," "medium," and "high."
   - Merges the DataFrames of book ratings, book information, and user information.

8. **text_process**
   - Normalizes text data by transforming all text into lowercase.
   - Handles mismatches in country formats to ensure uniformity in the dataset.

9. **compute_probability**
   - Computes the probability of a feature in the dataset.

10. **compute_entropy**
    - Computes the entropy of a feature in the dataset.

11. **compute_conditional_entropy**
    - Computes the conditional entropy of two features in the dataset.

12. **compute_information_gain**
    - Computes the information gain of a feature with respect to a target variable in the dataset.
